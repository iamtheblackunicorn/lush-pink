# LUSH PINK :ribbon: :rabbit:

***A lush pink theme for VS Code for all coding honey bunnies out there.*** :ribbon: :rabbit:

## ABOUT :books:

I've recently heard that GitHub has discontinued Atom, an editor I've been using for years now. For this reason, I switched over to VS Code and I want to use VS Code in such a way that it looks exactly how I want it to. This theme is my look and my theme.

## USAGE & INSTALLATION :ribbon:

Make sure that you have the following installed and available from the command line:

- Git
- VS Code

- 1.) Change directory into the `.vscode/extensions` directory on your system.
- 2.) Execute this command from the command line:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/lush-pink
```

- 3.) Open VS Code. Go to Settings > Extensions.
- 4.) Choose ***Lush Pink*** from the list on the left.
- 5.) Click `Set Color Theme`.
- 6.) Enjoy! :heart:
